# How to Publish Your React Form Validator Library to npm

## 🎯 Quick Summary

Your library is ready to publish! Here's what you need to do:

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Package Name Issue

The name `react-form-validator` is **already taken** on npm by another package.

**You have 3 options:**

### Option 1: Use a Scoped Package (Recommended)

Scoped packages are always available under your username:

- Name: `@shilpabijalwan/react-form-validator`
- Free to use
- Professional looking
- Package URL: `npm install @shilpabijalwan/react-form-validator`

### Option 2: Use "formease"

- Name: `formease`
- Short and memorable
- **AVAILABLE** ✅

### Option 3: Choose a Different Name

Pick something unique and not taken.

## 📋 Step-by-Step Publishing Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your Package Name

If you want to use **formease** (available name):

```bash
# Open package.json
# Change line 2 from:
"name": "react-form-validator",

# To:
"name": "formease",
```

Or for a scoped package (always works):

```bash
# Change to:
"name": "@shilpabijalwan/react-form-validator",
```

### Step 2: Create npm Account (if needed)

1. Go to https://www.npmjs.com/signup
2. Sign up with your email
3. Verify your email address

### Step 3: Login to npm

```bash
npm login
```

Enter your:

- Username
- Password
- Email
- OTP (if 2FA is enabled)

### Step 4: Test What Will Be Published

```bash
npm pack --dry-run
```

You should see:

```
npm notice Tarball Contents
npm notice README.md
npm notice dist/formvalidator.js
npm notice package.json
npm notice total files: 3
```

### Step 5: Build the Library

```bash
npm run build:lib
```

### Step 6: Publish!

#### For Regular Package (like "formease"):

```bash
npm publish
```

#### For Scoped Package:

```bash
npm publish --access public
```

The `--access public` flag is required for scoped packages or they're private by default.
